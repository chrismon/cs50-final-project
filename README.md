# AI Story Time
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I wrote this command-line tool in python for my 6-year old son. At night he can choose anything subject he wants and it will generate a bedtime story. The application uses OpenAI prompt to generate the text of the story, and Microsoft Azure's Speech Service API to generate and play an audio form of the story back to the user.
